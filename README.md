### Bugs:
##### Solved bugs:
- Changes to index.html did not commit due to ```git add .``` being ran inside the assets folder. 
    - This was resloved by going running ```git add .``` in the root directory

##### Unsolved bugs:
- Spanish internship on mobile is floating to the right and not aligning with with the Vietnam text
##### Solved bugs:

- Bottom FAQ overflows into the footer -- fixed by adjusting height of div container
